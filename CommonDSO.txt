## Common Data Structure Operations and its implementation on Python: ##


1. Array
Concept: Array is a Data Structure which can store a fixed-size collection
of elements of the same data type.

implementation:
Array = ['car', 'bus', 'truck', 'boat']
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Stack
Concept: Stack is a abstract data type and/or data structure
which is based on the concept of first in, first out.

implementaion:
stack = []
# append() function to push element in the stack
stack.append('a')
stack.append('b')

print('initial stack')
print(stack)

# pop() function to pop element from stack in LIFO order
print('/n Element popped from stack:')
print(stack.pop())
print(stack.pop())

print('/n Stack after elements are popped:')
print(stack)

OUTPUT:
initial stack
['a', 'b']

Elements popped from stack:
b
a
Stack after elements are popped:
[]
